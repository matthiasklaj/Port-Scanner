# Asynchronous Network Port Scanner

This project provides an asynchronous network port scanner written in Python, designed to efficiently scan a range of ports on a given host. It leverages Python's `asyncio` library to handle network operations concurrently, making it suitable for scanning multiple ports or hosts without significant delays.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Scanning:** Utilizes `asyncio` for non-blocking network operations, improving performance.
- **TCP and UDP Support:** Supports scanning both TCP and UDP ports.
- **Customizable Timeout:** Allows setting a timeout for socket operations to balance between speed and reliability.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. No additional packages are required beyond the standard library.

```bash
pip install asyncio
Usage
You can run the port scanner from the command line. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

bash
Copy code
python port_scanner.py <host> <port1> <port2> ... [--protocol <tcp|udp>]
Arguments
<host>: The IP address or hostname of the target host.
<port1> <port2> ...: A list of ports to scan.
--protocol <tcp|udp>: Specify the protocol to use. Default is tcp.
Example
To scan TCP ports 80 and 443 on the host example.com, use:

bash
Copy code
python port_scanner.py example.com 80 443 --protocol tcp
To scan UDP ports 53 and 67 on the host example.com, use:

bash
Copy code
python port_scanner.py example.com 53 67 --protocol udp
Code Explanation
scan_port(host, port, protocol): Scans a single port asynchronously. It handles both TCP and UDP protocols.
scan_ports(host, ports, protocol): Scans multiple ports asynchronously using asyncio.gather.
print_results(results): Prints the results of the scan.
Troubleshooting
Timeout Errors: If you encounter timeout errors, consider adjusting the TIMEOUT value in the code.
Permission Issues: On some systems, scanning certain ports may require elevated privileges.
